# LLM Powered Grading Assistant

This advanced autograding application revolutionizes the educational assessment process by leveraging the capabilities of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Language Learning Models (LLMs). Positioned in a burgeoning market estimated at around $250 billion, our solution addresses key challenges in the traditional grading system, which include the extensive time commitment, manual labor intensity, and the potential for inconsistencies and errors in marking. The current grading process, often consuming 66 hours of a 640-hour semester (estimation based on average), is a significant burden on educators, impacting their productivity and contributing to increased workloads. Our application aims to mitigate these issues by automating the grading process, significantly reducing the time invested in grading and providing a more consistent, error-free evaluation. This not only improves the efficiency of educators but also enhances the overall learning experience for students. The immediate feedback feature facilitates quicker learning opportunities and heightened student engagement. This comprehensive solution is poised to make a substantial impact in the educational technology sector, potentially capturing a significant portion of the market with an estimated value of 1.5 to 3 billion dollars. By increasing the productivity of professors, teachers, and graders, our application promises to transform the landscape of academic evaluation, promoting faster academic progress and a more effective education system.
